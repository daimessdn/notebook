| Oil name        | Depth            | Time         |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Heavier Tar Oil | shallow depth    | shorter time |
| Light Oil       | over 2000 meters | longer time  |

## Porosity ($\phi$​​)

- Or **pore space** determined by number and sizes of the rock pore.
- Larger pore space describes **higher porosity** (which is more fluid can be filled) and smaller pore space describes **lower porosity**.

| Rock name | Grain Characteristic                          | Porosity       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Sandstone | well rounded, well sorted                     | about 25%      |
|           | poorly sorted                                 | about 5% - 15% |
|           | cemented together<br />(reaction in wet clay) |                |

### Example of porosity

| 0% Porosity                                                  | 5% - 30% porosity                             | 100% Porosity |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Igneous rock (found in basement rock of reservoir), diamond, etc. | sandstone, dolomite, limestone, shale (lower) | water (only)  |

### Symmetrical theoretical rock porosity

### Cementing

- Happens when **sedimentary clays get wet** and chemical reaction happens.
- Will **decreases porosity** because it **seals off the spaces between rocks**, reducing pore space

### Intergranular porosity

Exists as **space between rock grains**.

### Vugular porosity

- Porosity formed where **holes in the rock surface** are formed.

- Typically found in limestone reservoirs after rock formation (lithification) (The rock is lifted to the surface (caused by activities such as earthquake), then dissolved by chemical reaction of carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub>) and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) to make ***carbonic acid*** (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>))

  ### Fractural porosity

  - Porosity formed by **fracture**.
  - Contributes by **increase pore space**.
  - In **oil well completion**, it is used to pump down acid under very high pressure to help create cracks (also called ***well stimulation***).

## Good reservoir rock

### Porous rock

Must have porosity.

### Permeability

- Properties which measures of flow of the fluids betweens rock grains (and also connectivity)
- Measured in *milidarcy* (*md*)

### Fluid saturation

- Can vary due to the way hydrocarbons displaced (in terms of **saturation percentage**) the seawater that was present when the rock was formed.
- In terms of saturation percentages: **oil % (S<sub>o</sub>), water % (S<sub>w</sub>) , and gas % (S<sub>g</sub>**).
- $$ S_g \% + S_w \% + S_o \% = 100 \% $$​​
- Useful for ***reservoir engineers​*** because they give a measure to an economic value of the reservoir (High S<sub>o</sub> and S<sub>g</sub> give the profitable reservoir).

### Relative permeability

- When you mix oil, gas, and water in a reservoir rock, they remain in **separate phases** and will flow to the reservoir channels at **different rates**.

- If the oil saturation is **small**, then the oil will create a **small drops** (due to its interfacial tension) and they wil not be connected to other drops so that it will **not flow**. Meanwhile, the water will **flow continuously** bypassing the oil drops (Water only is produced).
- For the small water saturation, oil will be continuously flow bypassing the water (immovable caused by capilarity forces of rock).

|             < 25% of water saturation condition              |              < 25% of oil saturation condition               | S<sub>o</sub> > 25% and S<sub>w</sub> > 25% |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
|                      only oil will flow                      |                     only water will flow                     |               both will flow                |

## Oil migration

Migration is the **movement of oil** from **source rock**, moves **upward** until it got trapped and accumulated. The engineers look for this trap to get the accumulation of oil.

### Source rock

- Source rock is a place of rock when the **oil is formed** for the first time.

- Usually a **shale rock** oil enriched with **dead organic material**.

- Oil from source rock will be migrated **vertically** or **horizontally** over a geological time.

  ### Impermeable cap rock

Impermeable cap rock is a rock that **will entrap the oil** and stop oil migration.
