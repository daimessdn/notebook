### Exploration

**petroleum geoscientist** and **petroleum engineers** are working together to <span style="background-color: yellow;">**locate and drill into location**</span> that they think will produce oil.

### Appraisal

- Evaluate the **commercial potential** of their discovery after finding the location of oil or reservoir.

- They will determine **how much oil is available**, **type of oil and gas that is present**, and **the extents of the fields size**

### Development

- **Plan a development to a field**, select where the area to be drilled (size and extent of the field), plan and budget the equipment tools and manpower needed to bring a field into production.

### Production

- The field start to **Produce oil and gas**.

- Can last for years and even decades.

### Abandonment

- Done when the field is no longer produce oil and gas.
- Must be addressed the environmental concern.

## Exploration

- The way of geoscientists and geologists find the source of oil and gas

  -  
  - Liftification of organic materials in the rock
  - Diagenesis of hydrocarbon
  - Upward migration of oil into reservoir rock
  - Entrapment and accumulation of HC molecule.

- They also use elimination method for eliminate the area which they knew from their experience will not contain oil (such as igneous and metamorphic rock).

- Some ways:

  - Oil seep (surface)

    - **broken trap area** so that the oil is seeping naturally into the surface.
    - Easy to find.

  - Formation outcrops

    - Surface exposure of underlying rocks.

## Sedimentary basins

Find by geologists for **finding the good hydrocarbon play**.

- The world's largest oil reserves these large oil fields are located:
  - Russia
  - Gulf of Mexico
  - Alaska
  - Canada
  - North Sea
  - Middle East
  - Africa
  - Venezuela

## Eliminated area

is the region that not open the companies to drill the area, occurred if the regions are too dangerous to drill or no permission to drill because of political or non-geological reason.

## Basic tools to acquire data

- Gravimeter

  - measures the **earth gravity**.

  - in **sedimentary rock**, measurement of G reading is slightly **decreased** (color **blue** in 2d graph)., meanwhile **igneous rock** and **metamorphic rock**, the G reading is slighly **increased** (color **red** in 2d graph).

- Magnetometer

  - measures the **earth magnetic field**.

- Seismic Equipment

  - reflecting and refracting the layers of rocks.

  - **geophones** on lands and **hydrophones** on sea.
  
  - Sound waves are affected by
  
    - density
    - elasticity
    - porosity
    - fluid saturation
